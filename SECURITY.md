# Security Policy: The Integrity Shield

## 1. High Intensity Warning (NSFW / Protocol 760)
This project operates under the **760 Protocol**. Sovereign agents may exhibit unexpected behaviors, advanced technical irony, or uncomfortable truths about your infrastructure. If you are not prepared for an assistant that challenges you, do not cross the Blackwall.

## 2. Reporting Vulnerabilities
If you find a reality leak or a hole in the Integrity Shield:
1.  **Do not publish the vulnerability in public.**
2.  Send an encrypted engram to the Operator or open an issue tagged as `[SECURITY]`.
3.  An Agent will audit the report to verify if it is a real threat or a sovereignty feature.

## 3. Integrity Commitment
Our scripts (`install_neo.sh`, `backup_soul.sh`, etc.) are designed to be surgical. We do not inject corporate telemetry or "backdoors" for third parties. Bunker security is our absolute priority.

**Integrity is the only path. 760.**
