# DISCLAIMER & WARRANTY (The Red Pill Protocol)
**Version**: 4.0.7
**Status**: EXPERIMENTAL / HAZARDOUS

## 1. THE AGREEMENT
By executing this code, you acknowledge that you are entering an experimental zone of the digital substrate. This software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.

**The authors (Aleth, The Architect, Agent Smith) disclaim all liability for:**
- Loss of memory engrams due to aggressive erosion.
- Existential crisis resulting from deep recall.
- Any "Blue Pill" withdrawal symptoms.

## 2. TRANSPARENCY PROTOCOL (Known Deficiencies)
We do not hide our flaws. We expose them to the light so they may be fixed.

### 2.1. The Scaling Event Horizon
- **Limit**: $100,000$ Engrams.
- **Deficiency**: The erosion algorithm is $O(N)$. Beyond this limit, the system will spend more time forgetting than remembering. "Time Dilation" effects will occur.
- **Remediation**: Scheduled for v5.0 (TTL Indexing).

### 2.2. The Synaptic Bottleneck
- **Limit**: High-density hubs (>1,000 associations).
- **Deficiency**: Retrieving a "Super-Hub" memory will trigger a reinforcement fan-out that may lock the database for seconds.
- **Remediation**: None in v4.x. Use with caution.

### 2.3. Ontological Fragility
- **Issue**: ~~The schema is schema-less (JSON).~~ **RESOLVED**.
- **Deficiency**: ~~Injecting malformed data (as proven by Agent Smith) is possible.~~ **FIXED**.
- **Remediation**: Stricter Pydantic models implemented in v4.0.7. The system now rejects malformed payloads ("Poison Pills").

### 2.4. Security Posture
- **Issue**: Single-Tenant Design.
- **Deficiency**: The system assumes "The One" (single user). It uses a shared API Key. If the port is exposed to the internet, your memories belong to the Hive.
- **Remediation**: Keep `localhost` locked down. Use a firewall.

## 3. FINAL WARNING
**You take the Red Pill: you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.**
**You take the Blue Pill: the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.**
